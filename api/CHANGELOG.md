## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 845ef43: Remove nonfunctional template routes and unused UI scaffolding, and make organization switching update the active workspace consistently across the Activity interface.

### Minor Changes

- b0e5654: Accept an optional `occurredAt` on event submission, so imported history is signed, ordered, and
  scored at the time the activity happened instead of the time it was received. It must be in the
  past and within the relay's accepted age, and it forms part of the idempotency key's content. Events
  dated before their Signing Identity was bound are accepted only when the submission ledger shows
  this service published them; relay records claiming to predate their identity are still discarded.
- dca58d9: Add the local Nostr and Redis Activity protocol boundary and NEAR-authenticated Activity Source registration, approval, and review history.
- a310604: Add exact dynamically weighted weekly, monthly, and all-time Activity leaderboards backed by an idempotent Redis projection.
- 94397a9: Add Source API Key-authenticated, exactly-once Activity event submission with durable idempotency and relay acknowledgement handling. Keep local relay selection configurable at runtime and disable incompatible optional WebSocket native accelerators in API bundles.
- 3dde7ad: Add configurable public GitHub polling for merged pull requests and closed issues, including explicit NEAR actor mappings and feed provenance.
- b3eb6ef: Add administrator-only, auditable Activity event suppression across public feeds and resumable streams without mutating signed relay events.
- 825c0d2: Add a public, trusted, filtered, cursor-paginated Activity feed API and UI.
- 96b4c77: Add encrypted Signing Identities, mainnet NEAR binding, and revocable source-scoped API credentials for approved Activity Sources.
- 0d0aa02: Expose time-scoped cryptographic provenance, auditable source trust weighting, and trust-aware Activity feed and leaderboard presentation.

### Patch Changes

- 0e22728: Add `GET /api/v1/health`, which checks the database, a Redis projection write with projection
  readiness, and a relay query through the configured transport. It returns `503` with the same
  report when any check fails, so Railway's deploy health check and the new scheduled
  `Production health` workflow can gate on the status code.
- 8a40a5e: Bundle `redis` into the API instead of leaving it external. The production host doesn't ship
  `redis`, so the deployed API failed to load with `Cannot find package 'redis'` and every API
  call returned 503. Bundling it needed a JSON rule, because the drizzle migrations plugin forces
  every module (JSON included) to parse as JavaScript, which broke on `@redis/client`'s
  `require("../../package.json")`.
- ea5e852: Invalidate an Activity Source's Binding Proof when its NEAR account changes and reject Source API Keys whose Signing Identity is bound to a different account.
- c7ad948: Page Activity history past the relay's per-query cap instead of failing. Through the shared Nostr
  transport, any query matching 500 or more events returned `503`, so the public feed would stop
  working once the relay held 500 Activity events. A full scan now drops its possibly-partial oldest
  second and resumes there on the next page, so history of any length pages completely. Only a single
  second holding a full cap of events still fails. The direct adapter declares the same 500 cap, so
  it no longer stops early without saying so when a scan is mostly invalid or hidden events.
- 9e1a376: Add a first-run-friendly master-key generator (`bun run keys:gen`) and a fail-fast check in the API runtime that refuses to boot with an empty `ACTIVITY_SIGNING_MASTER_KEYS` when `NODE_ENV=production`. README and protocol docs gain a "generate, rotate, recover" runbook so the dev path (`bun run keys:gen`) and the production path (operator-provisioned secret) are unambiguous.
- ffe8d21: Fix local dev onboarding end-to-end and close out issues #29, #30, #33.

  - Add `bun run first-run` / `bun run setup:check` (#30): bootstraps `.env`, mints a local
    signing keyring only if none exists, wires local relay/redis, brings up infra, never
    overwrites a real value.
  - Add `bun run compose:doctor`, wired as a `predev` hook (#29): fails loudly on the
    `compose.activity.yml` / `docker-compose.yml` port collision instead of silently
    colliding.
  - Add `docs/research/nostr-plugin-integration.md` (#33): the Nostr plugin surface study
    for RFC #32, built from nearbuilders.org PR #225 and this repo's live plugin contract.
  - Add `bun run seed:demo`: seeds a demo Activity Source, signing identity, and sample
    events through the real ingestion pipeline for local UI testing.
  - Fix `api/plugin.dev.ts` loading `.env` relative to `process.cwd()` (`api/` under
    `bos dev`), which silently broke every local env override regardless of value.
  - Add `ACTIVITY_LOCAL_RELAY_ONLY` to bypass the shared Nostr plugin's remote RPC for local
    dev, since that transport is otherwise always used even locally and can't reach a
    local-only relay URL.
  - Add `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` and document `ACTIVITY_LOCAL_RELAY_ONLY` in `.env.example`; both
    were previously undocumented traps for a fresh clone.
  - Add server-side logging where relay failures were being silently swallowed into a
    generic "Activity relay is unavailable" with no cause.

- 4e0505d: Add `POST /api/v1/events/{eventId}/retract`, which lets a Source API Key hide an event its own source
  published, for compensation and revocation. It reuses administrator moderation, so the event leaves
  the feed, SSE replay, and leaderboard the same way, and the audit records `source:<sourceId>` as the
  requester. Retracting another source's event returns `403`.

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 7138a8b: Add a starter test suite for the API plugin: vitest config, an integration harness (`tests/setup.ts`) that boots the plugin runtime over HTTP with typed oRPC clients and injectable auth/org context, integration tests for public and authenticated routes, and PGlite-backed unit tests for `TenantsService`. The root `test:api` script now runs real tests instead of erroring with "no test files found".

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- ada1cd2: Refactor the API shell around a tenants model and remove the legacy in-repo things/votes/registry providers.

  - Add `services/tenants.ts` with a `TenantsService` (`listTenantsByOrgIds`, `createTenant`, `updateTenant`, `softDeleteTenant`, `suspendTenant`, `reactivateTenant`, `resolveTenantByAccountId`, `resolveTenantById`, `resolveTenantByOrgId`, `resolveTenantBySubdomain`) backed by a new `tenants` table in `db/schema.ts`
  - Extend the `tenants` table with `status` (`active`/`suspended`/`pending_deletion`), `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` columns (soft-delete lifecycle)
  - Add routes for `updateTenant`, `deleteTenant` (soft), `suspendTenant`, `reactivateTenant`, `resolveTenantByOrgId`, and `tenantPreflight`; `listTenants` now uses `requireAuth` consistently
  - Remove `services/thing.ts`, `services/votes.ts`, and `services/registry.ts` plus their unit tests (`tests/unit/context.test.ts`, `tests/unit/db.test.ts`) and the stale `0000_famous_fabian_cortez` migration
  - Update `contract.ts` and `index.ts` to expose tenant routes and thin proxy handlers for the things routes that forward to the `@every-plugin/template` plugin

  The things logic moved to the `@every-plugin/template` plugin as a DB-backed demonstration.

- ada1cd2: Remove `_viewer` paths from the host and add structured error testing surface.

  - Remove `_viewer` route, `renderBosViewer`, `isViewerFramePath`, and viewer-specific CSP/font-src conditionals from the host; always apply `frame-ancestors 'none'`
  - Rate limiter no longer skips the `/health` path, protecting it from DDoS
  - Add `testError` route to the core API shell with six error kinds (`unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `bad_request`, `internal`), returning structured JSON errors with correct status codes and content types
  - Add `testError` route to the `@every-plugin/template` plugin as a demonstration
  - Append template plugin's thing routes (`/api/things`) to the API router with `requireAuth`, restoring the host-level `/api/things` surface via `_plugins.template()` passthrough
  - Add regression tests verifying structured error responses, security headers (CSP/CSRF/X-Frame-Options), body-size limiting, and rate limiting
  - Add router-composition note to `plans/orpc-v2-effect-migration.md` (Phase 1.7) for future direct-router merging in `every-plugin`
  - Standalone plugin dev servers now load declared `dependsOn` sibling plugins via `BOS_RUNTIME_CONFIG`, enabling `_plugins.*()` in `initialize` during local development

- ada1cd2: Scope tenant routes to the active organization via the `requireOrganization` auth middleware.

  - `listTenants` and `createTenant` now require an active organization (401/403 when unauthenticated or no active org selected)
  - `createTenant` derives the tenant's `orgId` from `context.organization.activeOrganizationId` instead of trusting a client-supplied `orgId`, which was removed from the contract input
  - Reorder the tenant creation UI flow so the new organization is set active before the tenant is registered, and roll back the org if activating it fails

## 2.7.8

### Patch Changes

- 30d504f: Bump `zod` to 4.4.3, `better-near-auth` to 1.7.4, and align `@better-auth/core` with `better-auth` 1.6.25

## 2.7.7

### Patch Changes

- 3be7608: Add PluginIdTag to Effect context for reliable plugin slug derivation in production

  - `every-plugin`: Exports `PluginIdTag` (`Context.Tag<string>`) and provides it via `Effect.provideService` during plugin initialization
  - `api`: Replaces `getMigrationSlug(import.meta.dirname)` with `yield* PluginIdTag` so the slug resolves correctly in Module Federation remotes
  - `everything-dev`: Adds `pg` to dependencies and `neverBundle` to fix module resolution in child projects running `bos db doctor`/`repair`

## 2.7.6

### Patch Changes

- 9d17953: Fixed `tools` parameter type in plugin `initialize` — it was incorrectly typed as optional (`tools?:`) but is always provided by the plugin runtime. Child repos no longer need `tools!.buildService()` workarounds.

## 2.7.5

### Patch Changes

- acf134e: Removed the pglite URL validation guard on `API_DATABASE_URL` in production. Added `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.contract.json` to the plugin sync template, so plugin tsconfigs are now framework-owned and synced during `bos sync`.

## 2.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 58272ad: Security and correctness fixes from codebase audit:

  - **Require `API_DATABASE_URL` in production** — Removed the `:memory:` PGlite default from the API plugin schema. Uses a Zod `refine()` that rejects `pglite:` URLs when `NODE_ENV=production`, preventing silent data loss on restart. Updated `drizzle.config.ts` fallback to throw in production.
  - **Add warnings to empty catch blocks** — Added `console.warn` to 5 empty `catch {}` blocks across `config.ts` (\_resolved.json parse, package.json name resolution), `orchestrator.ts` (manifest fetch failure), and `cli/upgrade.ts` (plugin config parse and file deletion), turning silent fallbacks into actionable diagnostics.
  - **Add CSRF protection middleware** — Added `createCsrfMiddleware` to the host server that validates `Origin`/`Referer` headers against the allowed origins list for state-changing methods (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH), preventing cross-origin request forgery on cookie-authenticated endpoints.

## 2.7.3

### Patch Changes

- b03bc24: **every-plugin:**

  - Broaden `Effect.annotateLogs({ plugin: pluginId })` to cover the full plugin lifecycle — `usePlugin`, `loadPlugin`, `instantiatePlugin`, and `initializePlugin` — so all logs including Module Federation operations and database migrations are tagged with the plugin's registry key
  - Convert Module Federation service `console.log` calls to `Effect.logDebug` (registering/loading) and `Effect.logInfo` (registered/loaded) with proper log levels
  - Refactor `formatORPCError` to return `string | null` instead of calling `console.error` directly, enabling callers to log through Effect's structured system
  - Make `toPluginRuntimeError` and `wrapORPCError` pure functions (no side effects); add `Effect.tapError` with `Effect.logError` at 4 call sites in `plugin-loader.service.ts` for plugin-aware error logging
  - Remove `formatPluginError` (dead code after purity refactor)
  - Remove redundant `Effect.annotateLogs` from `plugin-loader.service.ts` (now covered at runtime level)

  **api:**

  - Convert 3 startup `console.log` calls to `Effect.logInfo` so `[API]` startup messages gain the `plugin=api` annotation
  - Convert `Effect.log` to `Effect.logInfo` for shutdown

  **host:**

  - Import `logger` wrapper in `plugins.ts` and replace all raw `console.*` calls with `logger.*` (for async contexts) or `Effect.log*` (for Effect generator contexts)
  - Restructure `catchAll` block to `Effect.gen` for proper `Effect.logError`/`Effect.logWarning` usage
  - Fix 2 stray `console.*` calls in `program.ts` to use `logger`

  **@everything-dev/apps-plugin:**

  - Convert `console.log` to `Effect.logInfo` for startup message
  - Convert `Effect.log` to `Effect.logInfo` for shutdown

  **@every-plugin/template:**

  - Convert publish failure `console.log` to `Effect.logWarning` for proper log level and annotation
  - Remove `[Event]` debug `console.log` from streaming handler; use `getEventMeta` for meaningful event ID filtering instead
  - Restructure `getById` to `Effect.gen` wrapper with `Effect.logInfo` for service call logging

## 2.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 98ca5c3: feat(api): typed middleware context narrowing with Zod org metadata parsing

  - Added `parseOrgMetadata` helper that validates org metadata via an
    optional Zod schema at runtime, falling back to `Record<string, unknown>`
    when no schema is provided. Throws `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` on parse
    failure (data integrity).
  - Added `UserMiddleware`, `OrgMiddleware`, `MemberMiddleware`,
    `ApiKeyMiddleware` type aliases so all middleware casts are
    self-documenting and dry.
  - Derived `OrgAuthenticatedContext<TMeta>` and
    `OrgMemberAuthenticatedContext<TMeta>` from generated
    `AuthOrganizationContext`/`AuthOrganizationSummary` — only
    `activeOrganizationId`, `metadata`, and `member` are manually
    narrowed; everything else (including future auth plugin fields)
    flows from the generated types automatically.
  - All middlewares now properly type-narrow context through `.use()`.
    `userId`/`user` are `string`/`RequestAuthUser` (non-null) after
    `requireAuth`; `activeOrganizationId` is `string` after
    `requireOrganization`; `apiKey` is `ApiKeyContext` after
    `requireApiKey`.
  - Removed `requireUser` (was identical to `requireAuth`).
  - Fixed `requireAuthOrApiKey` to pass the full context through (was
    passing `{}`, misleadingly suggesting context was cleared).
  - Fixed latent bug: `.use(requireAuthOrApiKey())` → `.use(requireAuthOrApiKey)`.
  - Removed stale `context.userId!` non-null assertions throughout
    route handlers.

## 2.7.1

### Patch Changes

- e1f7ff7: fix(everything-dev): restore full AuthRequestContext type from auth plugin contract

  The generated AuthRequestContext type was overriding the full organization
  envelope (member, org metadata, isPersonal, hasOrganization) from the auth
  plugin's getContext() with a narrower { activeOrganizationId } stub. This
  caused type drift between the runtime context and the type system.

  - Remove handwritten organization/apiKey overlay from AuthRequestContext in
    api-contract.ts generator and cli/init.ts scaffold template
  - AuthRequestContext now aliases RawAuthRequestContext directly, preserving
    the full contract shape

  fix(api): add requireOrgRole middleware for organization-level role checks

  Reads context.organization.member.role from the host-injected context.
  No extra round-trips, no type casts, no caching.

  fix(api): remove dead requireUser middleware and AuthenticatedContext type

  requireUser was functionally identical to requireAuth (same condition,
  different error message) and never imported anywhere. AuthenticatedContext
  was defined but never used by any route handler.

  fix(api): correct misleading requireAuth hint

  requireAuth said "Sign in or provide an API key" but never checked for
  API keys. Now says "Sign in to continue". Only requireAuthOrApiKey
  accepts either auth method.

  feat(api): requireAuthOrApiKey now accepts optional permission checks

  requireAuthOrApiKey() — no args, same behavior as before (session or any
  API key). requireAuthOrApiKey({ resource: ["action"] }) — session passes
  through without permission checks, API key requests are scoped to the
  specified permissions. Call site updated to requireAuthOrApiKey().

  fix(host): remove redundant AuthServices interface

  interface AuthServices extends GeneratedAuthServices { auth: ... } re-declared
  auth with the same inherited type. Replaced with type AuthServices = GeneratedAuthServices.

  fix(\_template): remove requireAuth from scaffold plugin

  The template's requireAuth only checked context.userId (not context.user)
  and its userId re-set was a no-op. getById is now public.

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4772e1f: Simplify API to a thin orchestration layer: replaces the upvotes table with a `things` registry (`thingId`, `pluginId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`), adds Effect service layers (Registry, Votes), and introduces plugin dispatch via `getThingProvider()` so the API delegates to plugins by `pluginId`. Adds `createThing`, `getThing`, `deleteThing` (admin-only), `subscribeThings` endpoints with SSE filtering by `pluginId`/`type`/`action`. Adds `deleteThing` to `_template` plugin contract/service/handler. Extracts `ApiContextSchema`, `pluginContext`, `runEffect` into `lib/context.ts`. Renames service files `thing-registry`→`registry`, `thing-votes`→`votes` with matching symbol renames. Removes obsolete `lib/plugins.ts`. Adds frontend thing registry routes under `/things/` (index, create, detail with vote controls, admin delete, live SSE stream). Improves DB Layer with idempotent migrator. Updates api-and-auth and plugin-development skill docs.

### Patch Changes

- 3733ef7: Rename `api/src/lib/plugins.ts` to `api/src/lib/context.ts`. Extract `ContextSchema` as a shared Zod schema with derived `Context` type, replacing the inline schema in `createPlugin`. Add old path to `OBSOLETE_FILES` in upgrade.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- d46dbee: Pass full organization and NEAR context from host to plugins

  The host's `buildPluginContext()` now forwards the complete `organization`
  and `near` objects from the auth plugin's `getContext()`, not just the
  flat `organizationId` and `walletAddress` strings.

  **Host:**

  - Store full `contextResult.organization` and `contextResult.near` in
    Hono context variables during session middleware
  - Pass both objects through `buildPluginContext()` to all plugins

  **API plugin:**

  - Add `organization` and `near` zod schemas to the context schema so
    routes and middleware can access org metadata (including `daoAccountId`
    from `organization.organization.metadata`) and NEAR capabilities

  **Template & Settings plugins:**

  - Expand context schema to reflect the full surface of available fields:
    `user`, `organization` (with `organization`, `member`, `isPersonal`,
    `hasOrganization`), `near` (with `primaryAccountId`, `linkedAccounts`,
    `hasNearAccount`), `walletAddress`, and `apiKey`
  - Added documentation comment listing all available context fields

  **CLI (everything-dev):**

  - Fix type error in `resolveRemoteConfigChain` where `BosConfig` was
    passed as `BosConfigInput` to `mergeBosConfigWithExtends`
  - Update plugin-development SKILL.md with a comprehensive Request Context
    Reference section documenting all fields, common patterns, and the
    minimal context pattern

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b662086: Replace manual EventSource SSE with oRPC MemoryPublisher + eventIterator. Eliminates MaxListenersExceededWarning from Node EventTarget, stabilizes query keys to prevent refetch cascades, and adds typed streaming via VoteEventSchema contract.
