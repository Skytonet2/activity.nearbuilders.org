# ui

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- dca58d9: Add the local Nostr and Redis Activity protocol boundary and NEAR-authenticated Activity Source registration, approval, and review history.
- a310604: Add exact dynamically weighted weekly, monthly, and all-time Activity leaderboards backed by an idempotent Redis projection.
- 3dde7ad: Add configurable public GitHub polling for merged pull requests and closed issues, including explicit NEAR actor mappings and feed provenance.
- 825c0d2: Add a public, trusted, filtered, cursor-paginated Activity feed API and UI.
- 96b4c77: Add encrypted Signing Identities, mainnet NEAR binding, and revocable source-scoped API credentials for approved Activity Sources.
- 0d0aa02: Expose time-scoped cryptographic provenance, auditable source trust weighting, and trust-aware Activity feed and leaderboard presentation.

### Patch Changes

- 6d20354: Add a typed Activity RPC client package and remove the Beta banner from the site.
- 845ef43: Remove nonfunctional template routes and unused UI scaffolding, and make organization switching update the active workspace consistently across the Activity interface.
- 9e1a376: Add a first-run-friendly master-key generator (`bun run keys:gen`) and a fail-fast check in the API runtime that refuses to boot with an empty `ACTIVITY_SIGNING_MASTER_KEYS` when `NODE_ENV=production`. README and protocol docs gain a "generate, rotate, recover" runbook so the dev path (`bun run keys:gen`) and the production path (operator-provisioned secret) are unambiguous.

## 1.9.1

### Patch Changes

- f5fb888: Fix login redirect loop after successful sign-in by invalidating the session query before navigating. Use the typed `detectNearAccount` (removes `as any`) and `getNearClient()` for direct wallet transactions.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ada1cd2: Add a tenant creation flow and make primary screens tenant-aware, alongside new reusable UI primitives.

  - Add a new `/_layout/_authenticated/tenant/new` route with a multi-step `Stepper` flow for creating a tenant; create redirects to the new tenant detail page
  - Add a `/_layout/_authenticated/tenant/$tenantId` detail page with inline name/subdomain editing, status badge, suspend/reactivate/delete actions (which republish the tenant config with the matching status), a standalone "republish config" retry button, and links to the org and live site
  - Run a tenant preflight check on the creation form (reserved/taken subdomain warnings, disabled submit until available)
  - Make the home page, layout, settings, and organizations screens tenant-aware; replace the `wikiAccountId` org-metadata coupling with `resolveTenantByOrgId`
  - Add reusable UI primitives: `field`, `info-row`, `network-toggle`, `spinner`, `stepper`, `textarea`, `app-detail-content`, and `json-highlight`
  - Polish existing primitives (`button`, `checkbox`, `label`, `radio-group`, `separator`, `sonner`, `brand-element`, `theme-toggle`)

### Patch Changes

- ada1cd2: Route the things UI through the namespaced `template` plugin client and enforce auth on thing writes.

  - Things routes in the UI now call `apiClient.template.createThing`, `apiClient.template.getThing`, `apiClient.template.deleteThing`, and `apiClient.template.listThings` instead of the removed top-level `api` client methods; `live.tsx` no longer needs a cast to reach the template client
  - The parent API now proxies thing routes to the template plugin through the in-process `templateClient`, keeping `createThing`/`deleteThing` auth-protected at the API boundary with `requireAuth` while `getThing`/`listThings` remain public
  - The template plugin's `createThing` and `deleteThing` handlers no longer enforce auth themselves (auth is enforced by the parent API), so direct plugin-to-plugin calls don't depend on per-call auth context

- ada1cd2: Reorder the tenant creation pipeline to create the Better-Auth organization _before_ the irreversible NEAR subaccount, and roll back the org if subaccount creation or tenant registration fails. Add `parentHasFullAccess` and `minDeposit` subaccount config to the SIWN auth runtime variables.

  Make the FastKV config + metadata publish relayer-aware: use delegate action + relay when the relayer is configured, fall back to a direct transaction signed by the user's wallet as the new subaccount when the relayer is unavailable.

- ada1cd2: Scope tenant routes to the active organization via the `requireOrganization` auth middleware.

  - `listTenants` and `createTenant` now require an active organization (401/403 when unauthenticated or no active org selected)
  - `createTenant` derives the tenant's `orgId` from `context.organization.activeOrganizationId` instead of trusting a client-supplied `orgId`, which was removed from the contract input
  - Reorder the tenant creation UI flow so the new organization is set active before the tenant is registered, and roll back the org if activating it fails

## 1.8.4

### Patch Changes

- d03dd58: Inline `<script>` JSON is now escaped (`</script>`, U+2028, U+2029) to prevent XSS and script-breakage; the CSP nonce is serialized null-safe. Hydration failures now clear `__EVERYTHING_DEV_HYDRATE_PROMISE__` so a retry can succeed instead of permanently returning a rejected promise. An explicit `__EVERYTHING_DEV_SSR__` flag is injected during server render for reliable SSR detection. The `.env.example` template is expanded with all secret placeholders grouped by app section.

## 1.8.3

### Patch Changes

- b7f97e5: Fix React error #418 (hydration mismatch on the navigation progress bar) by wrapping the progress bar in `ClientOnly`. During SSR, `router.state.status` is `"pending"` (set by `router.beforeLoad()` during `router.load()` and never reset to `"idle"`), causing `isNavigating = true` and rendering the progress bar. On the client, the router is created fresh with `status: "idle"` and the `hydrate()` function only sets matches from dehydrated data without resetting status, so the progress bar is not rendered during hydration. This structural mismatch caused React to throw a hydration error. `ClientOnly` suppresses the progress bar during both SSR and initial hydration so they match, while still allowing it to appear during client-side navigation.

## 1.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 9a0220e: Fix React error #310 ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render") on first render by adding `defaultErrorComponent`, `defaultNotFoundComponent`, and `defaultPendingComponent` to the client router factory (`router.tsx`). The SSR router (`router.server.tsx`) already set these, but the client router did not, causing TanStack Router's `Match` component to resolve `ResolvedSuspenseBoundary` to `React.Suspense` on the server and `SafeFragment` on the client. This component-type mismatch at the same tree position during hydration forced React into a recovery path that triggered the hooks error.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 58272ad: Fix metadata files being blocked by narrowed static asset regex; standardize public file structure; renderClientShell delegates head data to UI's getRouteHead.

  - `host/src/program.ts`: Added `md` and `webmanifest` to `staticAssetPattern` (fixes regression from DDoS narrowing that blocked `.md` and `.webmanifest` from being proxied as static assets). DRY'd inline regex copy to use the named constant.
  - `host/src/program.ts`: Refactored `renderClientShell` to accept `HeadData` from the MF-loaded UI router module via `getRouteHead`. Host no longer hardcodes metadata (favicon, manifest, OG tags) — the UI's `__root.tsx` `head()` is the single source of truth. Minimal fallback shell (charset, viewport, title, boot scripts) when module is unavailable.
  - `packages/everything-dev/src/ui/router.ts`: Added `serializeHeadData` helper to convert structured `HeadData` (meta/links/scripts) to HTML strings for the raw shell.
  - `ui/public/`: Standardized on 15-file public structure. Renamed icon.svg→near.svg, icon_rev.svg→near_rev.svg, android-chrome-192x192.png→web-app-manifest-192x192.png, android-chrome-512x512.png→web-app-manifest-512x512.png. Generated favicon-96x96.png, logo.png. Removed legacy files (favicon-16x16.png, favicon-32x32.png, logo192.png, logo512.png, logo_rev.svg, logo.svg, manifest.json). Replaced manifest.json with site.webmanifest as single PWA manifest.
  - `ui/src/routes/__root.tsx`: Updated icon and manifest references to match new filenames.
  - `ui/public/site.webmanifest`: Merged richer icon set and fields from old manifest.json.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 86eaf89: Replace theme toggle colored circle with Sun/Moon icons from lucide-react
- 1368467: Remove auto-generated plugin-sidebar system in favor of manual sidebar items in `_layout.tsx`

  Deleted the entire `sidebar.ts` code generator, `SidebarItem`/`SidebarRole` types, all
  `sidebar` fields from config/resolution schemas, the `plugin-sidebar.gen.ts` generated file,
  and all sidebar migration/passthrough logic in the CLI, host runtime, and tenant runtime.
  Sidebar items are now defined inline in `ui/src/routes/_layout.tsx`.

### Patch Changes

- 86eaf89: Fix CSS chunk filename collision by overriding `CssExtractRspackPlugin.chunkFilename` to `static/css/async/[name].[contenthash].css`

  Async CSS chunks (e.g., from lazy-loaded `@uiw/react-md-editor`) were all emitting
  to the same path `static/css/async/style.css`. The plugin override gives each async
  chunk a unique, content-hashed filename while keeping the entry CSS at `style.css`.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4772e1f: Simplify API to a thin orchestration layer: replaces the upvotes table with a `things` registry (`thingId`, `pluginId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`), adds Effect service layers (Registry, Votes), and introduces plugin dispatch via `getThingProvider()` so the API delegates to plugins by `pluginId`. Adds `createThing`, `getThing`, `deleteThing` (admin-only), `subscribeThings` endpoints with SSE filtering by `pluginId`/`type`/`action`. Adds `deleteThing` to `_template` plugin contract/service/handler. Extracts `ApiContextSchema`, `pluginContext`, `runEffect` into `lib/context.ts`. Renames service files `thing-registry`→`registry`, `thing-votes`→`votes` with matching symbol renames. Removes obsolete `lib/plugins.ts`. Adds frontend thing registry routes under `/things/` (index, create, detail with vote controls, admin delete, live SSE stream). Improves DB Layer with idempotent migrator. Updates api-and-auth and plugin-development skill docs.

### Patch Changes

- 7cb0733: Remove `settings` and `projects` plugins, UI routes, and related component. Replace plugin IDs in tests with `example`.
- 7cb0733: `createApiClient` now accepts optional `headers` parameter for SSR cookie forwarding, allowing child projects to forward request cookies during server-side rendering. Also silences SSR-side console errors in the oRPC error interceptor and fixes the `sonner` shadcn import path in `__root.tsx`.

## 1.6.7

### Patch Changes

- caf22b7: Stop overwriting CONTRIBUTING.md during `bos sync`/`bos upgrade`

  Remove `CONTRIBUTING.md` from `FRAMEWORK_OWNED_SYNC_FILES` so user-customized
  contributing guides survive sync and upgrade operations. It is still scaffolded
  for new projects via `bos init`.

  Also add a `DO NOT MODIFY` warning to `ui/src/app.ts` with guidance that imports
  within the file must use relative paths (`./lib/...`), never `@/app`.

## 1.6.6

### Patch Changes

- 4bffb87: Update the UI auth client to a single options object that carries `runtimeConfig`, `headers`, and `cspNonce`, remove the deprecated `auth-utils` helper module during upgrades, and drop the direct `@hot-labs/near-connect` dependency from the UI package.

## 1.6.5

### Patch Changes

- d51b221: Update the UI auth client to a single options object that carries `runtimeConfig`, `headers`, and `cspNonce`, remove the deprecated `auth-utils` helper module during upgrades, and drop the direct `@hot-labs/near-connect` dependency from the UI package.

## 1.6.4

### Patch Changes

- 36b6cd7: Tighten CSP nonce handling across SSR, hydration, and fallback shells, and fix the BOS viewer bootstrap path.
- 36b6cd7: Restore public plugin RPC routing for the browser API contract and keep SSR/client hydration aligned under strict CSP.

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 3af34db: Version asset URLs to prevent stale-cache chunk failures

  Client boot assets (`remoteEntry.js`, `style.css`, plugin UI remote entries) now include a `?v=<integrity>` query parameter matching the SSR pattern. This ensures browsers and CDNs serve the correct asset set after each deploy, eliminating `ChunkLoadError` caused by cached `remoteEntry.js` referencing async chunks that no longer exist on the upstream deployment.

  Also fixes the `_viewer` regex from invalid `/^/+/` to `/^\/+/`.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 684bcab: Fix production CSP, viewer, and sign-out bugs

  - **CSP nonce**: pass `cspNonce` to `ThemeProvider` so the `next-themes` inline bootstrap script satisfies `script-src 'nonce-...'`. Without this, the browser blocks the script, causing a React hydration mismatch (#418) and cascading failures.
  - **Viewer regex**: fix invalid regex `/^/+/` in `_viewer` HTML template to `/^\/+/` so `widgetPath` leading slashes are correctly stripped instead of causing a SyntaxError.
  - **Sign-out navigation**: add `router.invalidate()` before `navigate()` in both `UserNav` and `SecuritySettings` sign-out handlers. Without this, TanStack Router's `beforeLoad` auth guards read stale session state and redirect back to the login page instead of the home page.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 8ef8f56: Replace UI asset 302 redirects with reverse proxy to fix Cloudflare 403 errors

  The host now proxies all UI public assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts, favicons) through the host origin instead of 302-redirecting browsers to the Zephyr CDN. This eliminates cross-origin requests that Cloudflare blocks with 403 errors.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `RenderOptions.assetsUrl` removed from `everything-dev/ui/types` — assets are now served from the host origin via root-relative paths
  - `RouterContext.assetsUrl` removed from `everything-dev/ui/types` — no longer needed since assets resolve through the host proxy
  - `getRemoteEntryScript()` removed from `everything-dev/ui/head` — use `getRemoteScripts()` which now returns `{ src: "/remoteEntry.js" }`
  - `RemoteScriptsOptions.assetsUrl` removed — `getRemoteScripts()` no longer needs an assets URL
  - `UnderConstruction` component: `assetsUrl` prop removed — images use rspack module imports directly
  - `ClientRuntimeConfig.assetsUrl` now set to the host origin (`requestUrl.origin`) instead of the CDN URL — existing consumers should note this value change

  **What changed:**

  - Host: `isUiPublicAssetPath()` deleted, logic inlined; `redirectUiAssetRequest()` replaced with `proxyUiAssetRequest()` using `proxyRequest()`
  - Host: `renderClientShell()` uses root-relative paths (`/favicon.ico`, `/remoteEntry.js`) instead of CDN URLs
  - Host: Plugin UI `<script>` tags use `/__mf/plugin-ui/${key}/remoteEntry.js` proxy paths
  - Host: `buildRuntimeClientConfig` sets `assetsUrl` to `requestUrl.origin`
  - UI: All `${assetsUrl}/path` references replaced with `/path` root-relative paths
  - UI: `new URL(importedAsset, assetsUrl)` pattern removed — rspack module imports used directly
  - UI: `/skill.md` fetched via root-relative path, no `assetsUrl` construction needed

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- dea876c: Remove `cspNonce` from ClientRuntimeConfig, fix SSR asset URLs, dissolve style-chrome

  - **everything-dev**: Remove `cspNonce` from `ClientRuntimeConfigSchema` (was leaking server-only value to client). Add `cspNonce` to `RouterContext`. Remove from `CreateRouterOptions`.
  - **ui**: Fix SSR asset URL mismatch — server `assetPrefix` now uses `bosConfig.app.ui.production` CDN URL instead of `/`, so imported assets resolve to the same absolute URL on both SSR and client. Dissolve `style-chrome.tsx` into `_layout.tsx`. Remove all `useClientValue` calls for runtime config reads (now use `runtimeConfig` from route context directly). Move `cspNonce` from L1 prop into `RouterContext`. Remove `getCspNonce()` from auth client. Add `runtimeConfig` prop to `UnderConstruction`.
  - **host**: Stop merging `cspNonce` into `runtimeConfig` for client shell.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- d26ed95: Pass CSP nonce through SSR pipeline and redirect UI assets instead of proxying to fix Cloudflare Error 1000

  **CSP nonce passthrough (production CSP script/style blocking fix):**

  The host generated a CSP nonce per request but never forwarded it to TanStack Router's SSR renderer, causing all inline scripts and styles to be blocked by `script-src 'nonce-...' 'strict-dynamic'` in production.

  - **everything-dev/types**: Add `cspNonce?: string` to `CreateRouterOptions` and `RenderOptions` interfaces
  - **everything-dev/types**: Add `cspNonce` to `RenderOptionsWithApi` (inherited from `RenderOptions`)
  - **ui/router.server**: Forward `cspNonce` to TanStack Router as `ssr: { nonce }` in `createRouter` and `renderToStream`
  - **ui/\_\_root**: Apply `nonce` from `useRouter().options.ssr?.nonce` to the `<style>` tag for base styles
  - **host/program**: Remove `as any` cast from `renderToStream` call — `cspNonce` is now a typed property
  - **host/tests**: Add regression tests verifying nonce appears on `<script>` and `<style>` tags when `cspNonce` is provided

  **Cloudflare Error 1000 fix (static asset 403s):**

  When both the host (Railway behind Cloudflare) and UI deployment (Zephyr Cloud behind Cloudflare) are orange-clouded, server-to-server proxying triggers Cloudflare Error 1000 "DNS points to prohibited IP". Browser requests to Zephyr Cloud work fine; only the host's `fetch()` proxy was blocked.

  - **host/program**: Replace `proxyUiAssetRequest` (server-to-server `fetch` proxy) with `redirectUiAssetRequest` (HTTP 302 redirect). The browser follows the redirect directly to the Zephyr Cloud origin, bypassing the Cloudflare-to-Cloudflare proxy loop
  - **ui/style-chrome**: Prefix rspack-imported `built_on.png` and `built_on_rev.png` with `assetsUrl` from runtime config so images load directly from the UI deployment origin instead of through the host
  - **ui/skill**: Use `assetsUrl` instead of `hostUrl` to fetch `/skill.md` directly from the UI origin
  - **host/tests**: Update `ui-public-assets.test.ts` — all UI asset tests now verify 302 redirect behavior instead of proxied content

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- dd5a7d4: Fix production SSR by keeping the UI auth client local during server rendering and by resolving SSR-imported asset URLs from the UI remote instead of the host origin.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b662086: Replace manual EventSource SSE with oRPC MemoryPublisher + eventIterator. Eliminates MaxListenersExceededWarning from Node EventTarget, stabilizes query keys to prevent refetch cascades, and adds typed streaming via VoteEventSchema contract.

### Patch Changes

- b662086: Move the homepage BOS viewer into an isolated iframe surface backed by a host-rendered `/_viewer` page.

  - Update `ui/src/routes/_layout/index.tsx` to load the landing viewer through `/_viewer` while preserving `?path=` support.
  - Add a dedicated host-rendered `/_viewer` endpoint with scoped CSP framing rules so the viewer can run in production without weakening the rest of the app.
  - Bootstrap the NEAR BOS web component from the host page so the requested widget path is forwarded correctly into the viewer runtime.

- b662086: Fix sidebar navigation to derive from plugin sidebar items and include projects

  - Updated `ui/src/routes/_layout.tsx` to properly consume generated `pluginSidebarItems` instead of using hardcoded navigation.
  - Fixed `packages/everything-dev/src/sidebar.ts` so the core `home` item points to `/home` (logo/dot still links to `/` for repository markdown render).
  - Added `plugins.projects.sidebar` to `bos.config.json` so the projects plugin appears in generated navigation.
  - Regenerated `ui/src/lib/plugin-sidebar.gen.ts` via `bos types gen` to include the `projects` sidebar item.
  - Fixed unbalanced JSX structure in `_layout.tsx` and removed stale/unused imports.

- b662086: Add a public skill surface for agents and builders, including a rendered `/skill` page, an updated raw `/skill.md` prompt, links from the about page, and a floating home-screen assistant that opens quick actions for the skill and related docs.
- b662086: Refactor the shared app shell by extracting the existing `_layout` chrome into `ui/src/components/style-chrome.tsx` without changing the intended authenticated and unauthenticated UI behavior.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 0e72704: Add notFoundComponent and errorComponent to root route, use shared sessionQueryKey constant, and improve OG image alt text.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- ef4a77b: Tighten the host CSP in production by switching to nonce-based script loading with `strict-dynamic` while keeping `unsafe-eval` for Module Federation. Also pass the host-provided CSP nonce into the NEAR auth client so wallet iframe scripts continue to run under the stricter policy.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 212ea6f: Clean up test infrastructure: proxy mock, dead env plumbing, and type cast

  - **host/tests**: Replace 80-line manual `AuthClient` mock with an 8-line
    `Proxy`-based mock that auto-implements any property, making it resilient
    to auth client API changes.
  - **host/tests**: Remove dead `vitest.setup.ts` and its `setupFiles` entry
    from `vitest.config.ts`. The `BOS_UI_URL`/`BOS_UI_SSR_URL` env var
    plumbing was unused after switching `loadTestRuntimeConfig` to read
    production URLs from `bos.config.json`. Simplify `global-setup.ts` to
    just build the UI dist (no HTTP server or env var setup needed).
  - **ui**: Remove unnecessary type cast in `renderToStream` —
    `renderOptions.authClient` is now typed directly via `RenderOptions`.
    Remove unused `AuthClient` type import.

- 521f85e: Fix SSR auth client injection, proxy test mock shape, and test config resolution

  - **host**: Pass `authClient` to SSR `renderToStream` so the host's pre-resolved auth client
    is reused instead of creating a new one from config. Export `toAuthClientContext` for use
    in program.ts. Proxy test mock updated to use correct `initialized.context` shape instead
    of putting handler directly on `initialized`.

  - **everything-dev**: Add optional `authClient` field to `RenderOptionsWithApi` type so
    callers can provide a pre-configured auth client for SSR rendering.

  - **ui**: `renderToStream` now uses `authClient` from render options when provided, falling
    back to `createAuthClient(runtimeConfig)` when not specified.

  - **host/tests**: Replace `process.env`-based `BOS_UI_URL`/`BOS_UI_SSR_URL` with production
    URL fallbacks from `bos.config.json` (`app.ui.production`, `app.ui.ssr`). Add
    `createMockAuthClient` helper returning a null-session auth client for SSR tests. Pass
    `session: null` and `authClient` in test render options to match production SSR semantics.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 81f2599: Add `title` and `description` fields to `bos.config.json`, runtime config, and `ClientRuntimeInfo`. SEO head metadata now reads `title`/`description` from `runtimeConfig.runtime` instead of hardcoded defaults. Also removes a debug console.log, fixes an outdated comment in app.ts, adds a Dockerfile comment, and adds a workflow comment for FCAK creation.

## 1.4.9

### Patch Changes

- ffa8200: Catalog-ify rspack/rsbuild packages and propagate via bos upgrade/sync

  - Add @rspack/core, @rspack/cli, @rsbuild/core, @rsbuild/plugin-react to root package.json catalog
  - Convert all workspace package.json rspack/rsbuild deps from version ranges to catalog: refs
  - Change every-plugin @rspack/core peerDep from exact 1.7.4 to range ^1.7.4
  - Add CATALOG_TOOL_PACKAGES to manifest-normalizer for catalog: conversion during init/sync
  - Extend bos upgrade to also bump catalog tool packages to latest npm versions
  - Extend bos status to report catalog tool package versions

## 1.4.8

### Patch Changes

- 6425196: Upgrade hono to >=4.12.18 to resolve 5 security vulnerabilities (CSS injection, JWT validation, cache leakage, XSS, bodyLimit bypass). Soften CI audit step to warn instead of fail on high/critical findings for build-time-only dependencies.
- 519ded7: Fix sidebar active state: use TanStack Router `useLocation()` for reactivity and segment-boundary matching to prevent false positives

## 1.4.7

### Patch Changes

- 09a1405: Restore the UI app barrel helpers used by route code so the build keeps working with runtime-config-driven pages.

## 1.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 21836cb: Remove legacy UI generator plumbing and tighten the scaffold surface so fresh projects and upgrades do not ship references to missing files.

## 1.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 482cca9: Expand shared UI auth dependency policy so downstream apps inherit singleton better-auth, better-near-auth, and Better Auth client addons through template sync. Declare the UI's direct Better Auth addon dependencies explicitly to avoid duplicate installs and nominal type mismatches.

## 1.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 9b69858: Expand the shared auth dependency policy so downstream apps inherit singleton `better-auth`, `better-near-auth`, and Better Auth client addons through template sync. Also declare the UI's direct Better Auth addon dependencies explicitly to avoid duplicate installs and nominal type mismatches.

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- e2a3d4a: Move theme toggle to fixed bottom-left position when not authenticated, keeping it always visible independent of page content.

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- f64f1a8: Fix theme toggle positioning: sticky sidebar on desktop with internal scrolling, add toggle to mobile bottom nav, and make it visible on desktop header when not authenticated.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- cd7692f: Strengthen the generated auth surface and remove duplicate client facades so downstream packages rely on the canonical typed auth client.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b06192b: Consolidate auth-client and session into single auth.ts with router context singleton pattern. Add useAuthClient() hook, remove runtimeConfig prop threading from components, upgrade better-near-auth to 1.4.0.

### Patch Changes

- 05c9fe2: Fix changeset CI errors: replace catalog: protocol for every-plugin dependency so changesets can resolve versions

## 1.3.4

### Patch Changes

- d920486: Export `Auth` type from generated auth-types.gen.ts for inferAdditionalFields

  The `auth-types.gen.ts` file now re-exports `Auth` from better-auth so
  the UI can use `inferAdditionalFields<Auth>()` instead of
  `inferAdditionalFields<typeof createAuthInstance>()`.

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 76c152b: Fix SSR runtime config errors by passing runtimeConfig to all auth clients

  `getAuthClient()` and `sessionQueryOptions()` were being called without `runtimeConfig` during server-side rendering, which caused `getRuntimeConfig()` to throw "Runtime config is only available in the browser". This propagated as repeated SSR 500 errors across all routes.

  Updated all route components and `UserNav` to read `runtimeConfig` from `Route.useRouteContext()` and pass it explicitly to `getAuthClient(runtimeConfig)` and `sessionQueryOptions(undefined, runtimeConfig)`. Also updated the `_layout.tsx` `beforeLoad` and `login.tsx` `beforeLoad`/`loader` to pass `context.runtimeConfig` into `sessionQueryOptions`.

  Files changed: `_layout.tsx`, `login.tsx`, `$gatewayId.tsx`, `home.tsx`, `settings.tsx`, `organizations/$id.tsx`, `organizations/index.tsx`, `organizations/new.tsx`, `projects/index.tsx`, `projects/$id.tsx`, and `user-nav.tsx`.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 2c58902: Remove stale `auth-client.gen.ts` and fix UI implicit-any TypeScript errors.

  - **everything-dev**: Removed `api/src/auth-client.gen.ts` from the `typesGen` generated file list in `plugin.ts`. This file was consolidated into `plugins-client.gen.ts` in a previous release but the metadata still referenced it, causing confusion when the stale file was left in workspaces.

  - **ui**: Added explicit type annotations to callback parameters in:
    - `src/routes/_layout/login.tsx`: `onError` callbacks for NEAR sign-in, passkey, anonymous, email, phone OTP, and GitHub social login.
    - `src/routes/_layout/apps/$accountId/$gatewayId.tsx`: `TransactionBuilder` parameter in two `buildSignedDelegateAction` calls.

  These fixes resolve `noImplicitAny` errors under `strict` mode without changing runtime behavior.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- b1adcb2: Fix SSR crash: pass runtimeConfig from router context to auth client instead of reading window.**RUNTIME_CONFIG** during server-side route matching

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c5fecc9: Switch from PGlite to Docker Postgres for development, fix multi-instance WASM crash, add auto-migration and infinite scroll for projects

  The host was crashing with `RuntimeError: Aborted()` because multiple PGlite WASM instances cannot coexist in a single Node.js process. This replaces in-process PGlite with Docker Postgres for development, and adds several related fixes:

  - Add `docker-compose.yml` with 3 postgres:17-alpine services (api:5432, auth:5433, projects:5434)
  - Add `dev:postgres`, `dev:postgres:down`, `dev:postgres:reset` convenience scripts
  - Declare `API_DATABASE_URL` and `PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL` secrets in `bos.config.json` so the host injects them into plugins
  - Conditionally disable SSL for localhost connections in `createDatabaseDriver` (3 files)
  - Add auto-migration to API and projects plugins on startup (matching auth plugin's existing pattern)
  - Fix projects `listProjects` pagination: move visibility filter from JS post-filter to SQL WHERE clause, add offset-based cursor pagination
  - Add infinite scroll with IntersectionObserver to projects list UI
  - Default project visibility to `public` instead of `private`
  - Show all visible projects (public/unlisted from everyone + own private) instead of filtering to current user only
  - Fix CI: replace broken `file:./api-test.db` with postgres service container

- f3f9e64: Migrate projects and API plugins to PostgreSQL with pglite fallback, add generic upvote system with SSE live ranking, and redesign projects page as a real-time ranked leaderboard.

  ### What Changed

  **API Plugin**

  - Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL (`pg` production, `pglite` local fallback)
  - Added `upvotes` table with unique constraint on `(thing_id, user_id)`
  - New upvote endpoints: `upvoteThing`, `downvoteThing`, `getUpvoteCount`, `getUpvoteFeed`
  - Real-time SSE stream at `/api/upvotes/stream` with in-memory pub/sub
  - Unified database defaults to `pglite:.bos/<plugin>/:memory:`

  **Projects Plugin**

  - Migrated from SQLite/libsql to PostgreSQL (same driver pattern as auth)
  - Dropped KV store (`kvStore` table, `KvService`, and all KV routes)
  - Regenerated Drizzle schema with `pgTable` and `timestamp with time zone`
  - Unified database defaults to `pglite:.bos/projects/:memory:`

  **Auth Plugin**

  - Updated default `AUTH_DATABASE_URL` to `pglite:.bos/auth/:memory:`
  - Driver now detects `:memory:` basename for true in-memory mode

  **UI**

  - Complete redesign of projects list page
  - Full-width horizontal cards with rank numbers (`#1`, `#2`, etc.)
  - Vote stack on right (↑ count ↓)
  - Projects sorted by upvote count descending
  - Framer Motion `Reorder.Group` for smooth rank transitions
  - SSE integration pushes live vote updates that trigger re-sorting
  - Removed legacy `keys/` KV test routes and UI

  **Config**

  - Updated `.env.example` with new PostgreSQL default comments
  - Removed `keys/**` from `bos.config.json` projects plugin routes

- 89c20cb: Remove opencode plugin and related UI routes

  ### What Changed

  - **Deleted** `plugins/opencode/` — the opencode plugin is no longer part of the project
  - **Deleted** `ui/src/routes/_layout/opencode.tsx` — removed the `/opencode` route page
  - **Updated** `ui/src/routes/_layout/_authenticated/_admin/dashboard.tsx` — replaced opencode-specific server/prompt tabs with a simple admin placeholder
  - **Updated** `ui/src/routes/_layout/about.tsx` — removed the `/opencode` link
  - **Updated** `ui/public/llms.txt` and `ui/public/skill.md` — removed `/opencode` from public paths
  - **Updated** `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` — removed opencode plugin references
  - **Updated** `bos.config.json` — removed the `opencode` plugin entry

### Patch Changes

- 033f41f: Add projects link to sidebar and mobile nav, fix missing useQuery import

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- e53af6e: Add CSP with feature flag, integrity registry, on-chain attestation, and safe plugin client factory

  CSP: Add `CSP_STRICT` const (default false) that toggles between relaxed mode (`'unsafe-inline'` + `'unsafe-eval'`) and strict mode (nonce + `'strict-dynamic'`). Relaxed mode is the default because Module Federation requires `'unsafe-eval'`, making strict inline script enforcement moot. All other CSP directives (object-src, base-uri, frame-ancestors, connect-src, etc.) remain enforced regardless of mode. When strict mode is enabled, nonces are injected into HTML script tags and the runtime config.

  Integrity: Add `IntegrityRegistry` class for SRI hash tracking, `installIntegrityFetchHook` for MF lifecycle fetch interception, `verifyConfigAgainstChain` for on-chain attestation checks, and `startIntegrityMonitor` for periodic background re-verification.

  Safety: Wrap plugin client factories with `createSafeClientFactory` to prevent arbitrary context injection. Merge CSP headers into SSR responses.

- 0a67206: Refactor dev orchestrator to service-descriptor architecture; add NEAR auth contract routes (nonce, verify, profile, relay, view); consolidate session queries in UI; add source-map devtool for plugin builds
- 34207e4: Reorganize dev port assignments: host=3000, api=3001, auth=3002, ui=3003, ui-ssr=3004, plugins=3010+

  Fix dev TUI display: host always shows "running" with port, remote non-host services show "loaded" without port. Strip ANSI codes from log files, only tag stderr as [ERR] when content is actually error-like, and replace Effect.logInfo with console.log in host logger for clean output.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c0452e7: Renamed `productionIntegrity` to `integrity` across all schemas, build configs, and `bos.config.json`. Added `name` and `version` fields to `BosPluginRef`. Enhanced `bos plugin add` with `bos://account/plugins/name` registry resolution, manifest validation, and automatic integrity computation. Enhanced `bos plugin publish` with manifest validation, integrity computation, and FastKV plugin registry writes. Added generic KV routes (`kvGet`, `kvList`, `kvPrepareWrite`, `kvRelayWrite`) to the registry plugin.
- db3ba6b: Remove near-kit dependency from UI. Delete near-client.ts wrapper and refactor gateway page to use authClient.near (buildSignedDelegateAction, relayTransaction) directly via better-near-auth.
- c29e058: Migrate auth from plugin to app-level infrastructure. Host mounts only the raw Better Auth handler; authClient is injected separately from pluginsClient. Plugins receive auth context per-request, not via injected clients. Projects plugin cleaned of auth-proxying routes. Deleted every-plugin/context.ts.
- 6428994: Switch from npm better-near-auth v0.6.0 to local file:../../lib/better-near-auth. Replaces @fastnear/wallet and @fastnear/near-connect with @hot-labs/near-connect + near-kit, removing the "Receiving connection details…" wallet modal hang. Also fixes session race condition in login redirect and NEAR sign-in pending state timing.
- 772b71e: Remove session.ts, adopt getAuthClient() and useSession() hook

  Delete centralized session.ts (query options, helpers, action wrappers). Replace authClient proxy export with getAuthClient() function. Switch from useQuery(sessionQueryOptions()) to authClient.useSession() hook throughout. Inline query/mutation definitions in components. Refactor login page from 8 useMutation hooks to async handlers with shared isPending state.

### Patch Changes

- a483214: Fix build and test issues after switching to local better-near-auth

  - Added `@hot-labs/near-connect@0.11.2` as a root dependency and override to resolve missing prebuilt artifacts from the GitHub version
  - Fixed duplicate `"clsx"` key in `ui/package.json` that caused `bun install` warnings
  - Updated `better-near-auth` API usage in `$gatewayId.tsx` to match new `buildSignedDelegateAction(receiverId, builderFn)` signature and `relayTransaction({ payload })` shape
  - Fixed `deposit` → `attachedDeposit: 0n` to satisfy `AmountInput` type requirements
  - Removed unused `normalizePath` function in `plugins/auth/rspack.config.js`
  - Fixed `EmitPluginManifest` `srcPath` from `"types/auth-export.d.ts"` to `"auth-export.d.ts"` (plugin already prefixes `types/`)
  - Added `--root .` to `api` vitest scripts to prevent test discovery leaking into other workspace packages

- 069cb6a: Upgrade better-near-auth from local file import to published v1.0.0

  Switches the workspace catalog entry from `file:../../lib/better-near-auth` to `^1.0.0`, consuming the official npm release. The v1.0.0 package already includes the near-kit + @hot-labs/near-connect migration and the relay API shape used by the gateway page, so no source code changes are required.

  - `relayer: {}` in server config continues to use all defaults (ephemeral auto-generated keypair)
  - Client `siwnClient({ recipient, networkId })` remains valid
  - `auth.near.buildSignedDelegateAction()` and `auth.near.relayTransaction({ payload })` APIs unchanged

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- d96b5d3: Enforce effect and zod as singleton shared dependencies across Module Federation runtime

  - Add `effect` and `zod` as direct dependencies in api, host, and ui packages with catalog-pinned exact versions
  - Move `every-plugin` from devDependencies to dependencies in api and ui (runtime import)
  - Add `effect` and `zod` to `bos.config.json` `shared.ui` as singleton MF shared deps to prevent duplicate runtime instances
  - Pin `effect`, `zod`, and `@orpc/*` to exact versions in workspace catalog and add overrides to eliminate version drift
  - Unify `@orpc/*` version refs across api, host, and ui to use catalog instead of mixed ranges
  - Update `every-plugin` mf-config to resolve effect/zod versions from installed packages instead of hardcoded ranges
  - Merge `overrides` field in sync flow's `mergePackageJson` to preserve user overrides during upgrade

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- f199d5e: Remove stale `./types` Module Federation expose pointing to non-existent `src/types/index.ts`, fixing build error

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- aeab5ce: Remove demo routes and fix plugin routing. API shell now only exposes `ping` and `authHealth` (with `requireAuth` middleware). Plugin-specific routes are registered before the base API catch-all in Hono, fixing 404s on `/api/rpc/{plugin}/*`. OpenAPI spec includes the current domain as an available server.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4efd2db: ## Extract business logic into plugins

  ### Breaking changes (api)

  All business routes have been removed from the `api` package. The API is now a thin structural shell with only health and error routes:

  - **Removed**: `listRegistryApps`, `getRegistryApp`, `getRegistryAppsByAccount`, `getRegistryAppByHost`, `getRegistryStatus`, `prepareRegistryMetadataWrite`, `relayRegistryMetadataWrite` (moved to `plugins/registry/`)
  - **Removed**: `listKeys`, `getValue`, `setValue`, `deleteKey` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listProjects`, `getProject`, `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `listProjectApps`, `linkAppToProject`, `unlinkAppFromProject`, `listProjectsForApp` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listApiKeys`, `createApiKey`, `deleteApiKey` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listOrgMembers`, `listOrgInvitations`, `cancelInvitation`, `resendInvitation` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Kept**: `ping`, `authHealth`, `publicError`, `protectedError`
  - **Kept**: `requireAuth`, `requireNearAccount`, `requireOrgRole` middleware (duplicated in plugins)

  ### New: registry plugin (`@everything-dev/registry-plugin`)

  FastKV app discovery, metadata publish/relay. No database required.

  - All registry routes from the API are now under `apiClient.registry.*`
  - Configuration via `REGISTRY_RELAY_*` secrets and optional `registryNamespace` variable

  ### New: projects plugin (`@everything-dev/projects-plugin`)

  Projects CRUD, KV store, org management, API keys. SQLite via libsql.

  - All projects/KV/org/API key routes from the API are now under `apiClient.projects.*`
  - Configuration via `PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL` and `PROJECTS_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` secrets

  ### UI changes

  Stale route files for organizations, keys, apps, and settings pages were removed. Project pages (detail, list, new) were later restored to work with the namespaced projects plugin client.

  All `apiClient` calls to business routes must now use namespaced access:

  - `apiClient.listRegistryApps()` → `apiClient.registry.listRegistryApps()`
  - `apiClient.getProject()` → `apiClient.projects.getProject()`
  - `apiClient.listKeys()` → `apiClient.projects.listKeys()`
  - etc.

- d4df05d: ## Infrastructure: CI optimization, Docker hardening, staging environments, config-driven architecture

  ### CI/CD improvements

  - **Consolidated lint + typecheck** into a single job (was 2 sequential), removing ~1-2 minutes per CI run
  - **Replaced `bun lint` + `bun format:check`** with single `biome ci .` command
  - **Pinned Bun version** to `"1.4"` in all workflows (was `latest`)
  - **Added native caching** via `setup-bun@v2` cache option (removed redundant `actions/cache`)
  - **Upgraded `actions/checkout`** from v6 to v4
  - **Parallelized typecheck** across packages using background processes (`& wait`)
  - **Staging deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/staging.yml`) — builds `:staging` image on merge to main
  - **Preview deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`) — builds `:pr-N` image per PR, comments preview URL
  - **CI workflows read domain from `bos.config.json`** via `jq` instead of hardcoding

  ### Docker hardening

  - **Non-root user**: Container now runs as `appuser` (UID 1001) instead of root
  - **Layer caching**: Dependencies installed before source code copy for better cache hits
  - **Bun 1.4**: Updated base image from `oven/bun:1.3.9-alpine` to `oven/bun:1.4-alpine`
  - **Added `curl` and `/health` healthcheck** with 30s interval
  - **Removed `Dockerfile.dev`**: Development flow uses `bos dev`, not a dev Docker image
  - **Added `railway.json`** for Railway deployment configuration with health checks

  ### Staging environment support

  - **Added `staging` field** to `BosConfigSchema` for staging domain configuration
  - **Added `--env` flag** to CLI start command supporting `production` and `staging` environments
  - **Updated `start` script** to accept `APP_ENV` environment variable for environment selection
  - **Staging mode** sets `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` from `config.staging.domain` and labels process as "Staging Mode"

  ### Config-driven architecture

  `bos.config.json` is now the single source of truth. All hardcoded values have been eliminated in favor of deriving from config at runtime or build time:

  - **Removed hardcoded defaults** from `package.json` start script — `--account` and `--domain` no longer have shell fallbacks; config is read from `bos.config.json`
  - **`BETTER_AUTH_URL`** now defaults to `config.hostUrl` instead of hardcoded `localhost:3000`
  - **`fastkv.ts`** mainnet fallback uses the actual `accountId` parameter instead of hardcoded `"dev.everything.near"`
  - **Host page title** uses `config.domain` instead of hardcoded `"everything.dev"`
  - **UI app name** is injected at build time from `bos.config.json` via rsbuild `source.define` (was hardcoded `"everything.dev"` in 15+ route files)
  - **UI `about.tsx`** registry query params use `activeRuntime.accountId`/`gatewayId` instead of hardcoded values

  ### Breaking changes

  - `BOS_ACCOUNT` and `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` are no longer default-encoded in Docker image — config comes from `bos.config.json`
  - Docker `CMD` no longer passes `--account` / `--domain` — use `APP_ENV` env var to switch environments
  - `BosConfigSchema` now includes optional `staging` field — existing configs are unaffected
  - `StartOptionsSchema` now includes optional `env` field — existing invocations are unaffected
  - UI `branding.ts` `APP_NAME` now reads from `import.meta.env.APP_NAME` with `"everything.dev"` fallback

- 8e378e3: Add opencode integration page, skill, and runtime config hot-swap design

  - New `/opencode` route with integration status and configuration
  - Admin dashboard updates for opencode management
  - Runtime config hot-swap design documentation

### Patch Changes

- 7e1286a: ## Security hardening: SRI integrity, CORS tightening, and config cleanup

  ### Subresource Integrity (SRI) for remote entries

  - **New `everything-dev/integrity` module** with `computeSriHash`, `computeSriHashForUrl`, and `verifySriForUrl` — single source of truth for all integrity operations
  - **Deploy hooks** now compute SHA-384 hashes of `remoteEntry.js` and write `productionIntegrity`/`ssrIntegrity` to `bos.config.json` on deploy
  - **Client-side SRI**: `<script>` tags for remote entries now include `integrity` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes
  - **Server-side SRI verification** before loading SSR modules, API plugins, and UI federation remotes
  - **Integrity plumbing**: `productionIntegrity` and `ssrIntegrity` fields flow through `BosConfig` → `RuntimeConfig` → `ClientRuntimeConfig` → HTML rendering

  ### CORS hardening

  - **`host/src/services/auth.ts`**: Better Auth `trustedOrigins` now falls back to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]` instead of `[]` when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset, aligning with Hono CORS middleware
  - **`host/src/program.ts`**: Production warning when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset; fixed bug where empty `uiConfig.url` could be included as a CORS origin
  - **`packages/everything-dev/src/host.ts`**: CORS origins now include UI URL in fallback; production warning added
  - **Production warning** added for missing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

  ### Config / type cleanup

  - **Removed `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl`** from `ClientRuntimeInfo` — these leaked arbitrary config data to the client
  - **Renamed `ActiveRuntimeInfo`** to `ClientRuntimeInfo` everywhere for consistency
  - **Deduplicated `SharedDepConfigSchema`** — now an alias for `SharedConfigSchema`
  - **Added `productionIntegrity`** to `BosConfigInput` interface, removing `as any` cast
  - **Added `testnet`** to `BosConfigSchema`

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fixed trailing slash inconsistency in host's SSR URL construction
  - Fixed SRI integrity check being inside Effect retry scope (now fails fast, only module loading is retried)
  - Added `integrity` verification to API plugin loading (`everything-dev/src/api.ts` and `host/src/services/plugins.ts`)

  ### Breaking changes

  - `ActiveRuntimeInfo` type removed — use `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl` removed from `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `BetterAuth` `trustedOrigins` default changed from `[]` to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]`

- 8e378e3: Restore project pages, remove stale organization/key/app pages

  - Restored projects detail, list, and new pages
  - Removed stale organization, keys, and apps route files

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d4a584d: Refactor navigation to use TanStack Router best practices

  - Replace internal navigation `<a>` tags with `<Link>` components for automatic intent-based preloading
  - Remove `as never` type casts from route definitions to restore proper TypeScript inference
  - Fix route param types for dynamic routes (organizations, projects, apps)
  - Fix optional search params type inference for `/apps` route
  - Improve type safety and autocomplete for route navigation
  - Preserve external links as `<a>` tags (API endpoint, external domains, static files)

  This enables automatic route preloading on hover/focus, improving navigation performance and user experience.

  - Add "My Projects" section to home page
  - Add "In Projects" section to app detail page showing which projects contain the app

### Patch Changes

- 44393e7: Fix published app discovery and FastKV publish flow so registry reads use the stored manifest data, publish can succeed after FastKV indexing, and the app explorer links directly to the FastKV config record.
- 44393e7: Refresh the splash-based social metadata and brand assets so the UI ships a stable preview image and matching black-dot favicon set.
- 44393e7: Add under construction page with NEAR CLI integration for session management and development tooling
